This project was developed by Bartosz Tchorowski for his thesis at the University of Zielona Góra. It consists of three main files:

data_processing.py – Prepares the data for further analysis and builds machine learning models.
DataAnalysis.py – Performs data analysis and generates visualizations to support the analytical process.
main.py – Implements the linear regression, random forest and decision tree models, performs hyperparameter tuning on each of them and compares their performances.
